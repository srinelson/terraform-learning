# 🚀 Terraform Learning Playground
Terraform sample script for Azure resource creation
Welcome to my little corner of the cloud universe — where I break stuff (on purpose 😏), learn, and build awesome infrastructure using Terraform.

## 📌 What's This About?
This repo is my **hands-on journey** with Terraform — from baby steps to production-grade deployments.  
Think of it as my personal lab notebook, but in code form.

## 🛠️ What's Inside?
- **Terraform Basics** → Providers, resources, variables, outputs.
- **Real-World Scenarios** → How to spin up VMs, networks, and other cloud goodies.
- **Experiments** → Testing new Terraform features and cloud services.

## 🚦 How to Use
1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srinelson/terraform-learning.git
   cd terraform-learning

# Navigate into it
cd terraform-learning

# Init Terraform
terraform init

# Apply your first infra!
terraform apply
